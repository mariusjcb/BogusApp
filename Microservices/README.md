# Microservices

In order to run microservices you should already have installed Docker / Docker Hub and Docker Compose.

To run all services, including api gateway, you should run the following command in Microservices root directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

If you prefer to run a single service just run this command in service subdirectory.
